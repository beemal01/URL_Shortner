A **URL Shortener using Python** is a simple tool that converts long URLs into shorter links using libraries like `pyshorteners`. It interacts with URL shortening services (e.g., TinyURL, Bitly) to generate compact links, making them easier to share and manage. It can also track clicks and analytics.
